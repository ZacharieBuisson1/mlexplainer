# Why MLExplainer ?

**MlExplainer** is a tool to address a massive question about advanced Machine Learning model in tabular data. 

Indeed, people often see advanced Machine Learning model (such as Boosting Models) as black-boxes. As of today, 
we want to provide a way to explain ML models through mathematics concept and be able to present the good working of a model
to everyone.

Key Features :

* **SHAP Integration**: Built-in support for SHAP explainers with optimized workflows
* **Multiple Classification Types**: Support for binary and multilabel classification tasks
* **Automatic Feature Detection**: Intelligent categorization of numerical, categorical, and string features
* **Rich Visualizations**: Integrated plotting for feature-target relationships and SHAP value distributions
* **Validation Tools**: Built-in interpretation consistency validation
* **Modern Architecture**: Clean, extensible design with proper abstractions
